            <p>By <a href="https://github.com/journadata">Beatriz Gálvez</a></p>
        </div>
            <p>Over the past 30 years, Catalonia has experienced significant forest fire activity, with certain years standing out as particularly devastating.

            These first weeks of July mark the 30th anniversary of the worst fires that took place in Catalonia since records began. The olderst people remember how devastated and fatal the fires were. 

            In fact, the first graph highlights 1994, 1998, and 2005 as record years with an unusually high number of forest fires. <element class="fira-sans-bold">  Notably, 1994 was a particularly catastrophic year, with 1,216 fires recorded.  </element> The chart points to two inflows of warm and dry air from North Africa in July 1994 as the cause of this surge in fires. These conditions created an environment highly conducive to the rapid spread of forest fires, resulting in extensive damage. </p>
        
        
            <iframe title="1994, 1998 and 2005: record years with more fires in Catalonia" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-w88qK" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/w88qK/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="475" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
            </script>
            <p>  In addition to the sheer number of fires, the impact on human life and property was severe. The 1994 fires resulted in five fatalities, 40 injuries, and the evacuation of approximately 7,000 people. This tragic toll underscored the urgent need for effective forest management and fire prevention strategies.</p>

            <iframe title="In 1986 and 1994 the largest areas burned in Catalonia were recorded" aria-label="Interactive area chart" id="datawrapper-chart-Jhrl2" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Jhrl2/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="459" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
            </script>
            <p>Also that year, there were a recod in numbers of fires. The area chart illustrates the total area burned by fires in Catalonia from 1980 to 2022. The chart highlights two peak years, 1986 and 1994, where the largest areas were affected by fires. In 1986, approximately 60,000 hectares burned, while in 1994, the number soared to around 70,000 hectares.

            <p>The data showcases the dramatic fluctuations in the area burned by fires over the years, emphasizing these two catastrophic events.</p>

            <p> Despite fire prevention efforts that the low figures show in the recent years, it is a reality that is difficult to control the origin of fires. But there are other alternatives to be able to recover the territory afterwards, such as deforestation.</p>

            <p>>What has Catalonia done to recover all this lost land in the past 30 years?</p>
            <p>Almost nothing, regarding the numbers. The second graph shows how much of the forest that's been burned there is still to be replanted. Since 1998, <element class="fira-sans-bold"> only 3.76% of the burned area has been replanted</element>, which shows that there's still a long way to go in terms of reforestation efforts. It's worth noting that 1998 and 2012 were particularly bad years for forest loss, with over 16,000 hectares burned in 2012 alone. </p>
    
            <p>Despite these large-scale losses, reforestation efforts have been pretty minimal, with only a fraction of the damaged areas seeing new trees planted.</p>

            <iframe title="Total surface burned in recent years is much higher than the reforestation" aria-label="Bullet Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-wTQFZ" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/wTQFZ/7/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="776" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
            </script>

            <p>The long-term trends illustrated in these charts indicate a pressing need for enhanced forest management practices in Catalonia. The frequency and intensity of forest fires are not only a threat to the environment but also to the communities that inhabit these regions. The significant disparity between forest loss and replanting efforts suggests that current strategies are insufficient to address the scale of the problem.</p>

            <p> In addition, several factors contribute to this ongoing challenge. Climate change is likely exacerbating the conditions that lead to such frequent and intense fires. </p>

        <p>The charts show that we must act to protect Catalonia's forests. The fires of 1994, 1998, and 2005, along with the ongoing reforestation challenges, show that we need to protect the forests for future generations.</p>
